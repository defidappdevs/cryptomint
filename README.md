This repository contains the orginal, current, and progressive versions of our Solidity Contracts and website files.
For now, it's all about collaborating easily and submitting our work for peer review, in preperation for the audits we're looking to achieve.
This script is still in the early stages, but we're looking to have many users access to our investment platforms, so we are working hard to 'get it right the first time'.

We hope you will use this repository to integrate your work into ours and build the best investment opportunity of 2021!
